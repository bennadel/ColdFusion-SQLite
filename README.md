# ColdFusion SQLite Exploration

By [Ben Nadel][bennadel]

This is an exploration in using [**Lucee CFML**][lucee]&mdash;an open source ColdFusion application server&mdash;to connect to a series of **[SQLite][sqlite]** databases. It uses the [`sqllite-jdbc` driver from Xerial][sqlite-jdbc]. And, creates _temporary_ datasources as outlined in [the CommandBox book][commandbox-book].

To be clear, I have _no idea_ what I'm doing&mdash;none of the code in this repository should be considered a best practice. I'm just playing around with some new ideas.
